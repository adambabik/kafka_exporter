# kafka_exporter

Kafka high-level Prometheus metrics exporter. For low-level metrics take a look at [jmx_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter).

This exporter supports multiple, namely [kafka-go](https://github.com/segmentio/kafka-go) and [confluent-kafka-go](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go). kafka-go has more features and does not require CGO, hence, it's recommended. **All releases and Docker images do not support Confluent client. If you want to use it, please build from the source.**

## Metrics

Below you can find a list of supported metrics. Metrics support is different per client and subject to change in the future.

## Usage

Usually, you will run kafka_exporter as a docker container and connect it to your Kafka cluster.

The public Docker image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/adambabik/kafka_exporter).

Alternatively, you can use a binary directly. Check out [Building > Binary](#binary) and run `kafka_exporter -h` or `go run ./cmd/kafka_exporter -h` in order to display all available flags.

In the case you want to test it locally, we recommend using `docker-compose up -d --build` and opening `http://localhost:9150` in the browser.

## Building

### Docker

```shell script
$ docker build -t kafka_exporter .
```

### Binary

```shell script
$ go build -o kafka_exporter ./cmd/kafka_exporter
```
